# Idle Game

This an idea for a game that I'm playing with, while I learn/improve my skills on JS (I'm not a JS dev).
I thought about using vanilla JS but I'll be using Vue.js instead since it solves most of the difficulties with rendering data in "real-time".

The main goal of the game is to build a civilization from year 0 (Something like stone age) and evolve it into an advanced intergalactic empire, by gathering resources, researching, adding population, conquering, questing, etc.

Ideally will have a Hero system also, with quests and related stuff.

## Running the game

For now just open the 'index.html' file on any browser (only tested on **Chrome** for now)

## Roadmap

- Add some styling (no styling at the moment)
- Add Buildings
- Add Upgrades
- Add Warfare units
- Add Warfare mechanics
- Add Hero units
- Add Quests for heroes
- Add Conquering mechanics
- Add Evolution mechanics
